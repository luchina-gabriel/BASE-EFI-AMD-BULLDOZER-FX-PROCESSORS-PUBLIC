# ACPI Tables - AMD

These files are **MUST** be included in your EFI's ACPI directory. We recommend that you use the **MANUAL** method, but for a first test you can use the prebuild versions.

Table|Description
:----|:----
SSDT-EC-USBX|[Manual](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Universal/ec-methods/manual.html) \| [Prebuilt](https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/raw/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-EC-USBX-DESKTOP.aml) \| [Details](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Universal/ec-fix.html)

### Dumping your DSDT in Windows Environment
[Download iASL Compiler ACPI Tools](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/774881/acpi-component-architecture-downloads-windows-binary-tools.html)
<br><br>
Open the CMD in the directory where the *ACPI Tools* was extracted. (*Command Prompt*) in **Administrator Mode**:
```
path/to/acpidump.exe -b -n DSDT -z
move dsdt.dat DSDT.aml
```

Decompile DSDT.aml:
```
path/to/iasl.exe path/to/DSDT.aml
```
*File DSDT.dsl will generated. Use this for generate YOUR ACPI Patches.* 

Compile DSDT.dsl:
```
path/to/iasl.exe path/to/DSDT.dsl
```
*File APCPI_FILE_PATCHED.aml will generated.*

# Attention

Update **config.plist** in PlatformInfo > Generic with YOUR informations.
<br><br>
*1. MLB (Board Serial)
<br>
2. ROM (Mac Address)
<br>
3. SystemSerialNumber (Serial)
<br>
4. SystemUUID (SmUUID)*

Please use [*genSMBIOS*](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for generate values for above itens.
<br>
Please use [*ProperTree*](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for configure/edit your config.plist.

# Compatible SMBIOS

SMBIOS|Description
:----|:----
iMacPro1,1|AMD RX Polaris and newer.
MacPro7,1|AMD RX Polaris and newer.<br>Note that MacPro7,1 is exclusive to macOS 10.15, Catalina and newer.
MacPro6,1|AMD R5/R7/R9 and older.
iMac14,2|Nvidia Kepler and newer.<br>Note: iMac14,2 is only supported to macOS 10.8-10.15, for macOS 11, Big Sur and newer please use MacPro7,1.

# Catalina and older versions of macOS

- Please configure `MinDate` and `MinVersion` in UEFI > APFS to `-1`;
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` in Misc > Security to `j137`;

\* *Without above settings, macOS will not be able to boot.*

# macOS Sonoma 14.4 or above versions
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` to `Disabled`;
- After the installation is completed, you can return the value to 'Default';
- If the above adjustment is not performed, the installation will be in a looping.

# Special notes

- USB port mapping is **REQUIRED**.
- **`XhciPortLimit`** - Please `**ENABLE**` to map the USB ports
	- You can use USBMap.command Utility - [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap).

## Special notes - Mapping CORES for AMD CPU

Core Count patch needs to be modified to boot your system.<br>
Find the four `algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package` patches and alter the `Replace` value only.

|   macOS Version      | Replace Value | New Value |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 10.13.x, 10.14.x     | B8000000 0000 | B8 < Core Count > 0000 0000 |
| 10.15.x, 11.x        | BA000000 0000 | BA < Core Count > 0000 0000 |
| 12.x, 13.0 to 13.2.1 | BA000000 0090 | BA < Core Count > 0000 0090 |
| 13.3                 |  BA000000 00  | BA < Core Count > 0000 00 |

From the table above substitue `< Core Count >` with the hexadecimal value matching your physical core count. <br>
Do not use your CPU's thread count. <br>
See the table below for the values matching your CPU core count.

| Core Count | Hexadecimal |
|------------|-------------|
|   2 Core   |     `02`    |
|   4 Core   |     `04`    |
|   6 Core   |     `06`    |
|   8 Core   |     `08`    |
|   12 Core  |     `0C`    |
|   16 Core  |     `10`    |
|   24 Core  |     `18`    |
|   32 Core  |     `20`    |

So for example, a user with a 6-core processor should use these `Replace` values: `B8 06 0000 0000` / `BA 06 0000 0000` / `BA 06 0000 0090` / `BA 06 0000 00`

**Note:** *MacOS Monterey installation requires `Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel` to be disabled in the config.<br />Also TPM needs to be disabled in the BIOS. Both can be enabled after install.*

## TRX40 Systems

Disabling the `mtrr_update_action - fix PAT` patch has shown an improvement in GPU performance on some systems that have tested. If you wish to test this it is recommended to do so on a USB with OpenCore to ensure it works first. There may be issues with different motherboard/GPU combos that we aren't aware of. Proceed at your own risk.

### General Purpose `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
npci=0x2000|This disables some PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`, alternative is `npci=0x3000` which disables debugging related to `gIOPCITunnelledKey` in addition.<br>Required for when getting stuck on `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if Above4GDecoding is enabled.**
npci=0x3000|Alternative for `npci=0x2000`.

### GPU-Specific `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
agdpmod=pikera|Used for disabling board ID checks on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series & RX 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.<br>**Don't use if you don't have Navi** (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this).
nvda_drv_vrl=1|Used for enabling Nvidia's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal cards in Sierra and High Sierra.

# BIOS Settings

### Disable
- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot
- Serial/COM Port
- Parallel Port
- Compatibility Support Module (CSM)(Must be off, GPU errors like `gIO` are common when this option in enabled)

### Enable
- Above 4G decoding
	- This must be on, if you can't find the option then add `npci=0x2000` to `boot-args`. 
	- Do not have both this option and `npci` in `boot-args` enabled at the same time.
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
- OS type: Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode
- SATA Mode: AHCI
